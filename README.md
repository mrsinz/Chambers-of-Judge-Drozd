# Chambers-of-Judge-Drozd

Hello and welcome to my chambers! My name is JustTheJudge1.

I’m from California, and I'm in my third year of a bachelor’s degree program in Paralegal Studies. I have been a practicing attorney and former judge/justice in this community for years. I’ve worked in private practice and in public service. Prior to my active service status, I was the AAG of the DOJ's Criminal Division. Outside of that, I enjoy teaching future legal professionals.

In my chambers, I go by the rules and overall realism. Through blood, sweat, and tears, I am confident that you will all learn how to handle business in my chambers. We can probably even do that without the blood!

I’m looking forward to working with you all and zealously serving again! Thank you @GrandpaGobies for bringing me into active service.
